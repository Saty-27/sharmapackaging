      <h2>Engineered Ocean Freight Protection for Industrial Machinery</h2>
      <p>Shipping heavy industrial equipment across oceans exposes your high-value cargo to severe conditions. Ocean voyages subject machinery to high humidity levels, saltwater spray, continuous engine vibrations, and significant shifting forces. To guarantee that your machinery arrives at the destination port in pristine condition, standard packaging is insufficient. You require engineered <strong>seaworthy packing in Vadodara</strong>.</p>
      
      <h3>Custom Wooden Crating & Framing (ISPM-15 Compliant)</h3>
      <p>Our wooden boxes, crates, bases, and internal braces are designed based on load-distribution principles. We ensure all timber packaging is fully compliant with the <strong>ISPM-15</strong> international standards, featuring the official IPPC certification stamps to enable smooth customs clearance in Europe, the USA, and worldwide. Our heavy-duty pallets can withstand tons of payload, ensuring complete protection during crane lifting operations.</p>
      
      <h3>Multi-Layer Environmental Barrier Systems</h3>
      <p>To block the corrosive saline atmosphere, we wrap and seal components using multi-layer aluminium barrier foils and active VCI (Volatile Corrosion Inhibitor) films. We extract the air from the foil to create a hermetic vacuum package and place container desiccants inside. This holds relative humidity below 40%, eliminating the possibility of rust, mildew, or electrical degradation.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>The Chemistry of Dry Rust Prevention (Volatile Corrosion Inhibitors)</h2>
      <p>Metal surfaces are highly vulnerable to corrosion when exposed to oxygen and moisture. Traditional rust-preventative oils are messy, require solvent cleaning at the destination, and create environmental disposal challenges. Our dry <strong>VCI packaging in Vadodara</strong> offers a cleaner, faster, and more cost-effective alternative.</p>
      
      <h3>How VCI Technology Works</h3>
      <p>VCI stands for <strong>Volatile Corrosion Inhibitor</strong>. The packaging material (film roll, bag, or paper sheet) is impregnated with specialized chemical compounds that continuously sublimate. These vapor molecules disperse throughout the sealed container and form a thin, monomolecular protective layer on the metallic surface. This barrier blocks the chemical oxidation reaction. When unpacked, the vapor dissipates cleanly, leaving the part ready for assembly.</p>
      
      <h3>Complete VCI Product Range</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VCI Film Rolls:</strong> Extruded polyethylene wraps providing mechanical strength and active rust prevention.</li>
